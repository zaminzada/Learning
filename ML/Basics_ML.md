ML

ML Types and associated tasks: Supervised (classification problems and regression problems), unsupervised (clustering, data generation, dimensionality visualization and reduction, density estimation), semi supervised (only some outputs/labels for each inputs/features), reinforcement (reward system)									
									
Some Algorithms (used for ML tasks in all types): Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbors, K means, Random Forest									
Workflow: Feed set of inputs (features) and expected outputs (labels) so after training there is now a model (hypothesis) that will now map new data to one of the categories trained on through prediction (prediction only works when model works well on unseen data)									
									
Training: Input (feature) > feature extraction > features > ML algorithm > Classifier Model > output (label) 			

Prediction: Same as above but inputs are new data
