Error in utils::install.packages("~/Desktop/Research Software/RNASeqAnalysis/kallisto/kallisto",  : 
  type == "both" cannot be used with 'repos = NULL'

CHATGPT
The error message you're seeing indicates that you're trying to install a package locally from a file path, but you've also specified repos = NULL, which is not compatible with installing from a local file.

If you're installing a package from a local file, you should not specify repos = NULL. Instead, you should simply provide the file path to the package as the first argument to install.packages().

Here's the corrected command:

R
Copy code
utils::install.packages("~/Desktop/Research Software/RNASeqAnalysis/kallisto/kallisto")
This will install the package located at the specified file path. Make sure that the file path is correct and points to a valid package file. If the file path is incorrect or the file is not a valid R package, you may encounter errors.

Warning: unable to access index for repository https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/el-capitan/contrib/3.5:

Warning message:
package ‘~/Desktop/Research Software/RNASeqAnalysis/kallisto/kallisto’ is not available (for R version 3.5.1) 

CHATGPT
The warning message you're encountering suggests that R is unable to access the package index from the CRAN repository. This warning is likely because you're using an older version of R (version 3.5.1), and the CRAN mirror you're trying to access does not support that version or the specific platform (macOS El Capitan) you're on.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

Update R: Consider updating your R installation to a more recent version. Newer versions of R often have better compatibility with CRAN repositories and packages.

Specify a Different CRAN Mirror: You can try specifying a different CRAN mirror that supports your R version and platform. You can do this by setting the repos parameter in the install.packages() function. For example:

R
Copy code
install.packages("~/Desktop/Research Software/RNASeqAnalysis/kallisto/kallisto", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/")
Replace "https://cloud.r-project.org/" with the URL of a CRAN mirror that supports your R version.

Install Dependencies: If the package you're trying to install has dependencies, make sure those dependencies are installed first. You can install dependencies using the dependencies = TRUE argument in the install.packages() function.

Check Package File: Ensure that the file you're trying to install is a valid R package file (.tar.gz or .zip) and that the file path is correct.

Consider Using devtools: If you're installing a package from a local directory, you can also consider using the devtools package, which provides additional functionality for package development and installation from GitHub or local files.

If you continue to encounter issues, please provide more details about your R environment, including your R version and operating system, so I can assist you further.

Troubleshooting steps may include checking file permissions, installing missing dependencies, verifying package files, or seeking assistance from the package maintainer or community forums.
